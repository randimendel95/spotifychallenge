1) Did you revieve help from any other sources?
Yes, I got some help from students in the TE lab, on short one line type questions, and I used the spotify-template for some code to initialize.

2) Did you complete advanced extensions? 
No

3) How many hours did it take you?
probably 12-14 hours

4) Any problems? 
Somewhat confused on usage of spotify API and things like referencing endpoints.  Also some confusion on calling functions on things that came from directives.  This was the main thing I was unable to complete in my work on this project, where I could not properly call the directive that I havd listed into the getSong fucntion to return the correct results.
